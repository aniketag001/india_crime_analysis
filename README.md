# **Caste-Based Crime Insights in India**

## **Introduction**  
This project provides a comprehensive platform for analyzing caste-based hate crimes across India. It visualizes crime patterns over the years, highlights correlations, and allows users to explore state-wise and category-wise data through an interactive and user-friendly interface. The platform aims to help identify areas requiring intervention to combat caste-based discrimination effectively.

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
The project assumes the use of CSV files as the primary data source, with Pandas for data processing and Streamlit for a user-friendly, interactive frontend. It relies on static data that can be visualized with Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, providing state- and category-wise analysis. The platform is designed for users with basic data analysis knowledge, offering easy exploration of caste-based crime trends and key performance indicators. Deployment is handled through Streamlit Cloud, ensuring automatic updates via GitHub commits.

## Installation & Getting Started | Setup the project in VS Code from Github
Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running:
